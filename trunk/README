
A manual can be found in the hygia/docs/manual directory. It's available
in several formats, although - at the moment - not completely finished.
Feel free to contribute! ;)

The class documentation can be found in the hygia/docs/api directory.
A starting point is hygia/docs/api-documentation.html
The documentation is extracted from the source code with Doxygen.

Install Hygia on a web server running a recent version of PHP and set
up a virtual host with the document root pointing to hygia/www.
Then you can start an example test suite by going to
http://hygia/?mod=examples
